>gnl|CDD|218169 pfam04604, L_biotic_typeA, Type-A lantibiotic.  Lantibiotics 
are antibiotic peptides distinguished by the presence of the 
rare thioether amino acids lanthionine and/or methyl-lanthionine. 
They are produced by Gram-positive bacteria as gene-encoded 
precursor peptides and undergo post-translational modification 
to generate the mature peptide. Based on their structural 
and functional features lantibiotics are currently divided 
into two major groups: the flexible amphiphilic type-A 
and the rather rigid and globular type-B. Type-A lantibiotics 
act primarily by pore formation in the bacterial membrane 
by a mechanism involving the interaction with specific docking 
molecules such as the membrane precursor lipid II.
